IWBTG page displays:
    All streams and thumbs that were captured for all streams set to IWBTG

Klazen page displays:
    All streams that Klazen follows, no matter their game



What happens if:
Klazen follows someone?
Klazen unfollows someone?
Someone stops playing IWBTG mid-stream?
Someone starts playing IWBTG mid-stream?
Someone is playing IWBTG part-stream AND Klazen follows them?

Right now the criteria for stream thumbs being captured is all the streams
returned by a certain Twitch API query.
This query could be: by game, by user follows.
Could also be: by community, or some other arbitrary unknown criteria.

It would be nice if the system could add new groups easily, rather than
me having to edit the app's code and re-deploy.

I want to support at minimum By Game (any game) and By User Follows (any user).

Maybe have Groups table, with id, Name, QueryType, QueryParam
And GroupStreams table, with id, groupid, streamid

If a stream shows up in a game query, add that stream to the group's inerest.
Note: Group has many streams, NOT Group has many channel names.

This will cause streams with only sections of IWBTG to show up in the
IWBTG page, but I think that's acceptable.

Answering the questions above:
1. Just start capturing that channel
2. Just stop capturing that channel
3. Keep capturing it til the stream ends
4. Start capturing from that point on
5. Capture the whole stream, and both Klazen and IWBTG pages will display it

We WON'T do any queries to Twitch for all the channels Klazen follows, to keep
it simple. There's no equivalent for Game queries, or others. Just base it off
of lists of currently live channels.
