Upon update, for each stream we see live:

Last archive is correct IF: stream ID matches archive ID

Find the most recently stream entry with that channel name.
    It is considered the current stream of the channel IF:
        it was last updated within the cutoff period (standard continuing stream)
        OPTIONAL OR: archive broadcast ID = DB stream's LastStreamId

If couldn't find the current stream entry, then make one:
    If archive != nil and archive is current, StartTime = archive.StartTime
    Else StartTime = current time
    

Insert the thumb with:
    If archive != nil and archive is current, VOD = archive.ID
    Else VOD = ""



TheNewDudos case: (has and old archived stream, current stream not archived)
    archive is calculated as NOT current
    not within cutoff period
    so, new stream created, start time = current time, VOD = ""

Starting new archived stream:
    archive is current
    not within cutoff period
    new stream created, start time = archive time, thumb vod = archive id

Continuing archived stream:
    archive is current
    within cutoff period
    update existing stream, thumb vod = archive id

Continuing archived stream but vod split in two:
    archive is current
    within cutoff period
    update existing stream, thumb vod = archive id
