Make the code a joy to work on.

New UI
Median(?) number of viewers of stream
Multiple channel group pages (fangames, Patrick, Klazen)
Display multiple titles (if 3 or less)

Error handing (!)
Logging (!)
DB hook up to repo (orm? ansible?)
Javascript timezone markers (+ fallback?)
Stats (unique channels in db, thumbs in db, last generated date)
Unicode stream titles and usernames

Handle error in CurrRowStruct() parsing date string "" (bad data in DB somehow)
Allow 1-2 thumb gaps but still considered same stream if random requests fail
Frontend - Page starts blank with buttons you can click to load haystacks
