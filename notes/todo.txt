Timestamps for VODs (Dexter)
    (Possibly track game viewership over time too?)
Clips
    We're emulating a query of top clips over a time frame.
    We want to update even after stream is finished.
    Every X minutes, query Top Clips of channel - past day, limit 100, views
    Iterate over list (it's sorted by views/popularity)
    
Make homepage more visual somehow, too textual.
    Color popular streams
    Length display as bar? ### vs #########
Mobile view. (check hckrnews)
    Clicking on stream loads a new page where you can scroll horizontally: big thumbnail on top, scroll bar on bottom
Show clips created during that stream.
    Check that clips are returned chronologically. Do we need to increase the query limit?
    Do CSS, choose top 2 clips.
    Prevent top clips from overlapping (Shadows' code: https://pastebin.com/5bHZ8d6S)
Make update concurrent (networking, database)
Add a few more games (Super Mario World, Games + Demos)



Much later:

Parallelize updates? might not be worth it
