streams = stream[]
for each channel:
    curStream = []
    for each thumb of that channel order by ascending time::
        curpos = thumb.pos()
        if curpos - lastpos > 1:
            streams.add(curStream)
            curStream = [thumb]
        else:
            curStream.append(thumb)
        lastpos = curpos
    streams.add(curStream)

start table being empty
we don't know the height of the table; needs to be dynamic.
order streams by starting point 
put first stream in the top row.
for the next stream, find the first free row from the top (at that starting point), creating new row at bottom if necessary, and put it there.
do that last step for each stream. :)



should we prefer to keep multiple streams by the same person on the same line?
well, is this an easy feature to add so we can test out if it bloats the view too much?
probably easy to add, but on second thought it might make the display confusing. hmmm. manually searching for a certain name is probably fast enough.
